Ah , so you browsed the files and found this , very well .

ML syllabus (a lot of it might be extra, but should rather be overprepared than underprepared) 

EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) –

Should know reason behind all things , Data visualizations (different types of graphs how to read them ) , missing values (mcar missing completely at random) 
, dropping , leaky variables , imputing mean median mode advantages disadvantages , ml models to predict missing values xgb imputer . Outlier detection , z score , 69 95 99.7 rule , iqr formula , 
box plot and interpretation , Scaling – standardization and normalization ka difference , robust scaling , min max scaling , numerical to categorical (binning , clustering) , 
categorical to numerical by ordinal encoding , ohe one hot encoding , target encoding , frequency encoding etc , imbalanced dataset – undersampling , oversampling , weighting dataset , nearmiss ,
random deletion , smote , borderline smote , adasyn 
Univariate analysis (statistics – mean median mode range standard deviation and variance) , bivariate analysis (correlations – pearson formula , spearman formula using rank , point biserial , phi) ,
correlation matrix how to interpret it , multivariate (multicollinearity , vif variable inflation factor and formula in terms of r), dummy variable trap in ohe ,
, how to cure skewed data log transform power transforms box cox transform etc 


Basic ML –

Deep Learning –

ANN artificial neural networks, perceptron structure , activation functions, how nn trains , backpropogation , gradient descent – stochastic batch and mini batch, adam ,
momentum based gradient descent variations , loss functions, transfer learning , cnn structure different layers , n+2p-f/s + 1 formula , rnn , gru and lstm , basics of computer vision
